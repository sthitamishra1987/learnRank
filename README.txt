Each row is a query-document pair. The first column is relevance label of this pair, the second column is
query id and the following columns are features of documents. The larger the relevance label, the more 
relevant the query-document pair. A query-document pair is represented by a 46-dimensional feature vector.
However, in this subset, we have extracted 6 features 43, 7, 6, 9, 8, 10 which are all zeros. So there is
a total of 40 features.
